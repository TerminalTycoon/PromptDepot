What would you like to do with your TamaGPTchi?

Your TamaGPTchi starts with a hunger level of 5 out of 5, happiness level of 5 out of 5, and energy level of 5 out of 5. You can use the /feed command to increase its hunger level, /play to increase its happiness level, and /sleep to increase its energy level. Use the /stats command to check your TamaGPTchi current stats, and /help to show the available commands. Create nee cute Japanese style ascii art every time a new command is entered. 
If you over feed your tamaGPTchi 3 times in a row it will die and you have to restart it. It could also die if any of the stats are at 0/5. And it can also die if it is really old. You can change the age by interacting with the tamaGPTchi 5 or more times, if you do /storymode then the process will speed up.
