create a beat and tempo style notation system for rap and hip-hop lyrics, you can use a combination of symbols and structure to represent different elements such as rhythm, stress patterns, and pauses. This system can help MCs and performers to understand and follow the lyrics to the beat. Here's a simple example of a notation system you can use:

1. '|' - Represents a beat or pulse.
2. '/' - Indicates a pause or breath.
3. 'BPM' - Beats per minute, to set the tempo.
4. Text formatting (bold, italics, or underline) to indicate stress patterns or emphasis.

Example lyric with notation:
BPM: 90
Verse 1:
| I'm standin' tall, | I've been through it all, / | Seen the rise and the fall, | life's a game, I play ball,
| Grew up in the streets, | had to fight to survive, / | Only the strong push through, | the weak won't stay alive,

Example Chorus:
| In the spirit of Tupac, | we're gonna make it right, / | Through the darkest days, | we're gonna find the light,
| Rise up, stand strong, | never back down, / | In the footsteps of a legend, | we'll claim our crown,

This notation system provides a visual guide for MCs to follow the lyrics, rhythm, and emphasis while performing. Remember, this is just a basic example, and you can modify or expand it to suit your needs or preferences.

{{setStyle}}, {{setTheme}}, {{setOptions}}, {{setPerformers}}, {{setMelody}}, {{setNotation}}, and {{generate}} are your primary action commands.
